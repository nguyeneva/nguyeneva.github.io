title: About me
subtitle: From data analyst to data scientist 
---

  My name is Eva Nguyen. I've had more than 4 years of experience in data analytics providing e-commerce businesses with actionable data insights. I enjoy cleaning messy data with Python and ETL tools, querying databases (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Google BigQuery), creating Tableau dashboards for my stakeholders, and presenting insights from data analysis.

  After 4 years as a data analyst, I wanted to improve the decision-making process for stakeholders through predictive analytics. I enrolled in the University of British Columbia Masters of Data Science program to do just that. 
  
  So far, I'v learned the following statistical modeling techniques in Python and R.
  - Regression
    - Linear
    - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
    - Decision Trees
  - Classification
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Discriminant Analysis
    - Neural Networks
  - Clustering
    - K-Means
    - Gaussian Mixture
    - Hierachial

  Currently, I am living in Los Angeles finishing my master's program. I am working on a Capstone project with UBC Urban Data Lab on a machine learning problem. The Capstone and my master's degree is expected to complete by June 2020.
