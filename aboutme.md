With over 4 years of experience in data analytics providing e-commerce businesses with actionable data insights. I've developed the skills to clean messy data with Python and ETL tools, query databases (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Google BigQuery), create Tableau dashboards for my stakeholders, and present insights from data analysis. In addition to my time as an analyst, I managed a team of analysts, was awarded Employee of the Quarter, and worked cross-functionally with many teams (executive, senior leadership, marketing, product, IT, customer support).  

After 4 years as a data analyst, I wanted to improve the decision-making process for stakeholders through predictive analytics. I enrolled in the Masters of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia to do just that.

I have experience implementing the following statistical techniques in Python and R.

  - Regression
    - Linear
    - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
    - Decision Trees
  - Classification
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Discriminant Analysis
    - Neural Networks
  - Clustering
    - K-Means
    - Gaussian Mixture
    - Hierarchal

### Current Work
I recently completed my Masters of Data Science program and my Capstone project with [UBC Urban Data Lab](https://urbandatalab.io/project/analyzing-ubc-building-energy-use/). We implemented machine learning techniques to categorize building sensors on UBC campus.

### Other Interests
When I am not cleaning data or debugging, I enjoy playing tennis, reading autobiographies, and trying new recipes to cook. Also, I care a great deal about the community I live in. I've been volunteering at local homeless shelters for more than 5 years. I organize monthly events to make and distribute lunches+care packages to homeless encampments. More than 1,500 lunches and care packages have been distributed.

Community Involvement:
