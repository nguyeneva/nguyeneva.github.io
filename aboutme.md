title: About me
subtitle: From data analyst to data scientist
---

With over 4 years of experience in data analytics providing e-commerce businesses with actionable data insights. I've developed the skills to clean messy data with Python and ETL tools, query databases (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Google BigQuery), create Tableau dashboards for my stakeholders, and present insights from data analysis. In addition to my time as an analyst, I managed a team of analysts, was awarded Employee of the Quarter, and worked cross-functionally with many teams (executive, senior leadership, marketing, product, IT, customer support).  

After 4 years as a data analyst, I wanted to improve the decision-making process for stakeholders through predictive analytics. I enrolled in the Masters of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia to do just that.

So far, I've learned to implement the following statistical modeling techniques in Python and R.
  - Regression
    - Linear
    - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
    - Decision Trees
  - Classification
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Discriminant Analysis
    - Neural Networks
  - Clustering
    - K-Means
    - Gaussian Mixture
    - Hierarchal

### Current Work
Currently, I'm completing my master's program in Los Angeles. I'm working on a Capstone project with [UBC Urban Data Lab](https://urbandatalab.io/project/analyzing-ubc-building-energy-use/). We'll be implementing machine learning techniques for end-use classification of sensors and energy forecasting for buildings on UBC campus. The Capstone project and my master's degree are expected to complete by June 2020.

### Other Interests
When I am not cleaning data or debugging, I enjoy playing tennis, reading autobiographies, and trying new recipes to cook. Also, I care a great deal about the community I live in. I volunteer at local homeless shelters to assist with guest services, and I organize monthly events to make and distribute lunches to homeless encampments.
